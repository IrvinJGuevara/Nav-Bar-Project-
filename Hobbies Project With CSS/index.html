        <p>One of my main hobbies that i do on a day to day basis is listen to music. I don't generally have any
            preference
            of music, I usually like anything I can vibe to or something that fits my mood.I've been listening to
            different
            types of music all my life and if I have to choose a favorite type of music, i'd probably choose
            oldies like The Peguinins,Rosie & The Originals, The Temptations,or The Dubs, however currently my favorite
            album is IGOR by Tyler The Creator. Another one of my hobbies is
            to play videogames. I prefer to play MOBA's,aka (Multiplayer online battle arena), like Smite, LoL, Heros of
            the Storm, Dota, etc.
            .I have played other games like R6, Black Ops,Injustice & Mk and many more. I dont really like fortnite
            however I do play it, just because my friends do and I have nothing else
            to play but most of the time i find myself playing other games. </p>

        <p2>Another one of my hobbies that i like to do is play sports. I like to play soccer and football and
            occasionally some basketball although i'm not very good at it. I also really
            love riding my bike around, it helps clear my head and allows me to get some form exercise. I also play
            Pokemon
            Go while riding my bike and i know it's a dead game but I still enjoy playing it since I like the franchise.
            My
            final hobby would have to be eating. I really love to eat and try out new foods. I am however a very picky
            eater. I dont like a lot of foods, or generally anything that has onions because to me onions are nasty. I
            do however have an open mind when trying new foods, like if it looks appetizing then i wont really mind if
            it has onions so long as its good.
